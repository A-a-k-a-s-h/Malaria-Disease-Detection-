# Deep Learning Model for Malaria Prediction
## Introduction 
Malaria is a significant burden on our health care system and it is a major cause of death in many developing countries. It is endemic in some parts of the world which means that the disease is regularly found in the region. Therefore, early testing is necessary to detect malaria and save lives. Thus, it gives us the motivation to make malaria diagnosis more faster and effective. A specialized technology proves essential to combat this problem. The Deep learning approaches have been successful in diagnosis of a disease.

## Objective
The objective of Malaria Disease Detection is to build the Deep learning model to detect whether the person is infected with Malaria disease or not using the blood cell images of the patient. The aim of the project is to address the challenges in the existing system by automating the process of Malaria Disease Detection using Deep Learning and Image Processing.

## Accessibility
The Malaria Detection Model can be accessed via the streamlit https://a-a-k-a-s-h-malaria-disease-detection--app-xqch3q.streamlit.app/ 
And the Model has been built as Mobile Application using GoNative App Builder
