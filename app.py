        This is datasets of segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images from the Malaria Screener research activity.
        The Dataset is obtained from researchers at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC),
        part of National Library of Medicine (NLM), that developed a mobile application that runs on a standard Android smartphone attached to a conventional light microscope. 
        Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slides from 150 P. falciparum-infected and 50 healthy patients were collected and photographed 
        at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh. The smartphoneâ€™s built-in camera acquired images of slides for each microscopic field of view. 
        The images were manually annotated by an expert slide reader at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand. 
        The de-identified images and annotations are archived at NLM (IRB#12972). then applied a level-set based algorithm to detect and segment the red blood cells. 
        The dataset contains a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells
